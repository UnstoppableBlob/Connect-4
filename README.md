# Connect 4 Game (in-browser)

Play a 2 player game of Connect 4. I tried SolidJS this time instead of React, and I think I like it more than React (I still need to try Svelte though).

Unlike my battleship and chess games this is between two players locally.

**How to play:** just click the link, get someone to play with, and take turns playing moves until someone wins
